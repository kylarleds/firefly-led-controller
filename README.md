# firefly-led-controller
PCB for the FireFly LED Controller

Necessary improvements:
  * USB C holes should be more exact so it fits better
  * Support for 4 pin ws2812b strips
  

Possibile Improvements to make:
  * Support for 12V on board??? (5v regulator, 5v dataline, but 12v power somehow?)
  * Support for automatically detecting strip length based on current drawn by strip (either "off" current or turning 1 on at a time, need ammeter)
  * Support for battery charging
